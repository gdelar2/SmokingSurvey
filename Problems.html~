<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First off, the biggest problem we faced
with this project was getting Necessitas running on our computers. In
fact, that was a problem we were never able to solve, so we ended up
doing our project using Java.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With that, we were put on a bit of a
time crunch. We had to decide which features were the most important,
and which ones were going to be an &ldquo;if we get around to it&rdquo;
type of feature. Despite the time crunch, our group was very pleased
with the progress we made on the app, only having a feature or two
that we didn't get around to implementing.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>Regarding problems that exist
within our code, we had a few problems that we were not able to get
around to resolving. Here is a list of the ones we weren't able to
get around to:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slider questions don't work. For
	some reason when it displays the sliding bar on the phone 	screen it
	appears very small, and there is no room to drag it around and
	select an answer</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Our write function works, but
	currently only displays the questions that were visited by the user,
		as well as the date/time. It should be a very minor implementation,
	simply writing the 	selected answers for each question we visit, but
	Professor Leigh had said that what 	we were presenting should be our
	complete project.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Random prompts is not completely
	implemented. We had everything set up for them to be 	implemented,
	but because Professor Leigh said we shouldn't add more to it after
	the 	presentation, we left it as is. We have a button which displays
	the random prompt, and it 	should be as simple as having it grab
	times randomly and prompting the user to take a 	survey in order to
	get this implemented.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We didn't get around to the admin
	page, which would be where we would have pulled the data 	off the
	phone to the desktop. Currently, we are opening the file and viewing
	it's contents 	using DDMS on Eclipse.</P>
