<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When we first chose our project, we
began having meetings a couple times a week to discuss what we wanted
to do with the project, possible features for it, etc. Early on, the
time we were supposed to spend developing was spent trying to figure
out why QT kept crashing when we tried to run our program. Trips to
the TA's office hours were made, and anytime one issue was resolved
it seemed that another one took it's place.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a while of struggling with
Necessitas we decided to ask if we could switch IDEs. After being
given permission, we knew we had a lot of catching up to do in order
to be done with our project by the deadline.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Michael then got started on the app.
The first thing to be done was to get a basic file input reader
going. After that a button was added to toggle through different
parts of the input file and display the new text to the screen. A
basic undo button was made which could jump back to a previous line
in the text file. A write was also made which would write the line
being viewed currently to the phone.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With these things in place, we had a
good starting point for making our survey demo. We simply had to
tweak the features we currently had, and add a few more advanced
features after we had a basic survey application up and running.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A parser was developed to read in the
questions/answers. After this, we needed to update the questions
being displayed to the screen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eventually we decided we wanted to add
a few more types of questions (at first we only had buttons, but we
decided the user might want to input more than one answer in some
cases). This required a more complex UI. Gus was put in charge of
this.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each question type was dynamically
created on the fly depending on which type of question the user was
supposed to be seeing. An arraylist was created which stored all the
questions before the program ran, which is different than in the
original implementation where we read the file line by line as we
needed it. We decided this was a good way to proceed with this
because we also knew we were going to have non-linear question
progression.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The UI was in progress of being
developed, but that didn't mean we could just halt development on the
rest of the project until it was finished. We began brainstorming on
a way we could do the non-linear questions. After coming up with a 
way to do it, we then got to work doing it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We had to add a &lt;locations&gt; tag
to the input file, which would display the location each answer
should jump to if the user selects that as their answer. If that is
to be the end of the branch of questions, a -1 should be put for that
answer, and our program knows to ignore it and move on to the next
questions (or display the end screen if there are no questions left
to display) A few problems were encountered during this phase, and
eventually we were able to work out the bugs involving it. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kevin then got to work on random
prompts. He eventually discovered a way to send a notification to the
user when a button is selected. After that, he was able to tweak it
to be able to send a notification after a few seconds of selecting
the button. By finding random times to display the notification, we
would be able to add random prompts as a feature to our program.</P>
