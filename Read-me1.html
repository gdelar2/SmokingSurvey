<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Motivation:  After hearing about the
opportunity to help out the UIC medical center with an android app,
we all thought it would be an awesome opportunity to take part in the
application John O'Keef was looking to be made. The app sounded
interesting to us, and we wanted to be part of an app that could help
impact the future in some way.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Design:  Schematics of our structures, as well as a short summary of the steps involved in the development process</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Problems: Basically a small summary sheet of things we have noticed are not working the way they should be, or things that were in development that got left out due to time constraints.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instructions: A short step by step tutorial on how to run the program. Features are identical to those we presented to the class, so we focus more on the installing of the program using Eclipse rather than the actual usage of the app.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Project files: The project directory for our app. Includes all of the files we had, including the input file we used as demonstration in class.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">OPPM: A list of all the features we were working on, their estimated completion date, and the date it was actually completed on.</P>
